WikiPathways is a biological pathway database and describes the interactions between
biochemical entities in biological processes [<cite>Q21092742</cite>,<cite>Q28090976</cite>,<cite>Q24082733</cite>,<cite>Q42896569</cite>].
It can be downloaded and used in various formats, one of which is the Resource
Description Framework (RDF) [<cite>Q26261238</cite>].

The WikiPathways SPARQL <topic>endpoint</topic> can be found at [http://sparql.wikipathways.org/](http://sparql.wikipathways.org/).
SPARQL allows you to query much of the content of the the WikiPathways data in
a machine readable way, which has been used, for example, in the Open&nbsp;PHACTS project
[<cite>Q27061937</cite>,<cite>Q54404976</cite>].

This book discusses how SPARQL can be used to extract information, using numerous example
queries, like the following to get metadata about the data loaded into the SPARQL endpoint.

## Metadata queries

The following query provides some information about what is currently loaded
in the public SPARQL endpoint at [http://sparql.wikipathways.org](http://sparql.wikipathways.org):

<sparql>metadata</sparql>

Which gives as output:

<out>metadata</out>

## Statistics

The give some idea of the content of the SPARQL endpoint, this section gives some overall
statistics.

### Number of pathways per species
